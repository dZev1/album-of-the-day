Have you ever felt like you were stuck in a loop with the music you listened to? Well, I came up with a solution.

This project was made with GoLang in the backend side of the project, connected to a relational database, and TS on the frontend. This was my first project so it isn't the best thing.

I asked DeepSeek to make the frontend CSS, since I do not have the best styling choices myself. I will see if I, at some point, will come back at this and make it better, such as putting things inside the database from an external API or something.
